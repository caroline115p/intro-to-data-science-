    "Your models from the last assignment really impressed some of the management in your football club.  In the spirit of Moneyball (it was a book before it was a movie, I recomend you read it), managers want to test some hypotheses relating a player's overall rating and some of their characteristics in order to make better decisions on what players to trade/sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management heard somewhere on the internet that statistics and data science are more or less the same thing (the truth of this is the subject of many debates) and would now like you to create some *statistical models* for inference instead of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you're going to take off your \"data\" hat and put on your \"science\" hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To test some of the management's hypotheses, the football club has spent some money to go out and collect new data in `footballer_sample.csv`.  The variables are more or less the same from the previous dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contain 52 columns, including some information about the player, their skills, and their overall measure as an effective footballer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most features relate to the player's abilities in football related skills, such as passing, shooting, dribbling, etc.  Some features are rated on a 1-5 scale (5 being the best), others are rated on 0-100 (100 being the best), and others still are categorical (e.g. work rate is coded as low, medium, or high).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable (or $y$ variable, if you will) is `overall`.  This is an overall measure of the footballer's skill and is rated from 0 to 100.  The most amazingly skilled footballer would be rated 100, where as I would struggle to score more than a 20. The model(s) you build should use the other features to predict `overall`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the data and take a look at the dataframe.  There should be 52 columns. The outcome of interest is called `overall` which gives an overall measure of player performance. Not all of the other columns are particularly useful for modelling though (for instance, `ID` is just a unique identifier for the player.  This is essentially an arbitrary number and has no bearing on the player's rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the Senior Data Scientist from the last assignment thinks the following columns should be removed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ID\n",
    "* club\n",
    "* club_logo\n",
    "* birth_date\n",
    "* flag\n",
    "* nationality\n",
    "* photo\n",
    "* potential\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That still sounds like a pretty good idea.  Remove those columns.  Keep the categorical variables as they are encoded.  Statsmodels will automatically dummy encode them for us"

Regarding the club's preference for left-footed players as a result of the randomization test you saw that the p value of the effect of being right footed is weak evidence so it against the null hypotheses, which is fail to reject the null hypothesis.
